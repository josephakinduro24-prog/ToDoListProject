## 1. Project Title
*To-Do List Application*

---

## 2. Project Description
The To-Do List Application is a simple command-line software system that allows users to manage daily tasks efficiently. The application enables users to add tasks, view all tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks. This project demonstrates the practical application of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

## 3. Problem Statement
Many individuals struggle to keep track of their daily activities. Forgetting tasks can result in poor time management and reduced productivity. There is a need for a simple system that helps users organize and manage tasks effectively.

## 4. Aim and Objectives

### Aim
To design and implement a simple To-Do List Application using Python.

### Objectives
- To allow users to add new tasks  
- To display all saved tasks  
- To mark tasks as completed  
- To delete tasks from the list  
- To demonstrate the full SDLC process

## 6. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

### 6.1 Requirement Analysis
The following requirements were identified:
- The system must accept user input  
- The system must store tasks in a list  
- The system must display tasks  
- The system must allow tasks to be marked as completed  
- The system must allow tasks to be deleted  

### 6.2 System Design
The system uses a menu-driven design where users select options using numbers.

*Design Components:*
- Task List (list of dictionaries)  
- Menu Interface  
- Functions:
  - add_task()
  - view_tasks()
  - complete_task()
  - delete_task()

### 6.3 Implementation
The application was implemented using Python. Each function performs a specific operation exactly as defined in the system design stage.

### 6.4 Testing
The system was tested using the following test cases:
- Adding a task  
- Viewing tasks  
- Marking a task as completed  
- Deleting a task  
- Entering invalid menu options  

### 6.5 Deployment
The project was deployed by pushing the source code and documentation to a GitHub repository.

### 6.6 Maintenance
Future improvements may include:
- Saving tasks to a file  
- Adding task deadlines  
- Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI)
